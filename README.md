# PD-Injector SMD Verison

Based on earlier Versions by 
Jana-Marie Hemsing [https://github.com/Jana-Marie/PD-Injector](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/PD-Injector)
and Clara Hobbs	[https://git.clarahobbs.com/pd-buddy/pd-buddy-wye](https://git.clarahobbs.com/pd-buddy/pd-buddy-wye)

There the PCB itself was used as connector. This version uses common USB-C connectors so any PCB thickness can be used. It also only connects the USB2.0 data lines.


This is a USB power delivery Power/Data injector. It has PCB USB-C input sockets and one output plug, the data lines from one input and the power lines from the other are combined and present at the output. Therefore you can have a data connection from your (not PD capable) computer, while having power from a power supply.
